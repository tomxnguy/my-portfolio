    This was my final project from the coding bootcamp, where I developed a fully functional e-commerce website.
    Through this project, I learned how to design and implement a scalable front-end using React and TypeScript,
    and styled the application with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
    I also used React Router to enable seamless navigation between product categories, shopping cart, and checkout pages.

    Additionally, I gained hands-on experience deploying the application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, where I configured the environment,
    managed resources, and ensured the app was accessible online. This project helped me deepen my understanding of cloud deployment,
    as well as front-end development best practices.
